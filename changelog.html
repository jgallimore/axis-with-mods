</ul>

<h2>Axis 1.2.1</h2>

<h3>Changes from 1.2final</h3>
<ul>
<li> Cleanup array handling for rpc/lit and doc/lit
<li> Enhancements to HTTPSender/CommonsHTTPSender (including better cookie support)
<li> Generate array of wrappers for soapenc array nillable elements
<li> Better handling of elementFormDefault during dynamic wsdl generation
<li> Fix for gracefully handling IncompatibleClassChangeError in websphere/weblogic
<li> Better SAAJ support (dirty flag was not set leading to serialization problems)
<li> Fix out-of-memory errors for services without attachments returning large response messages
<li> Last but not the least more test cases...
</ul>

<h3>Changes from 1.2rc3</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Tons of changes to typemapping system to better support jax-rpc1.1 and .NET
 <li> Improved SAAJ 1.2 support
 <li> Much better for rpc/lit and doc/lit (especially for arrays)
 <li>Map schema "wrapped" arrays (with inner &lt;item&gt; elements) into arrays of the item type, instead of JavaBeans, by default.  Introduce the "-w" or "--wrapArrays" option to WSDL2Java to switch back to the earlier behavior.
 <li> Fix some WS-I related bugs. Makes it easier to deploy WS-I BP compatible services.
 <li> Internationalized happyaxis jsp pages.
 <li> Updated to latest dependency jars. (ex wsdl4j-1.5.1.jar)
 <li> Improved commons httpclient support.
 <li> Support for sending and receiving multiple cookies
 <li> Lots of fixes for performance enhancements (including eliminating ThreadLocal's)
 <li> Improved JMX support - Start/Stop server/services and deploy/modify services
</ul>

<h3>Changes from 1.2beta2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>When generating WSDL, don't change the scoping rules for type mappings.  In other words, use the most specific mappings just like we do for message processing.
 <li>Fix problem with version string
 <li>Remove JAXP interfaces (should come from jaxp.jar, not jaxrpc.jar)
</ul>

<h3>Changes from 1.1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Preliminary SAAJ 1.2 support!</li>
  <li>Improved doc/literal support</li>
  <li>Improved handling of array types + WSDL generation</li>
  <li>More logical type mapping registration (SOAP-ENC types are in a separate registry which then delegates to the default one)</li>
  <li>Improved schema support (we deal with lists and groups now)</li>
  <li>ServiceDesc metadata is now more generic - ServiceDesc is an interface and JavaServiceDesc implements it to do specific Java processing.</li>
  <li>Throw fault when bad values for "mustUnderstand" attribute are parsed</li>
  <li>log4j.properties is no longer in axis.jar. This is to avoid conflicts
   with the configuration files in other bits of the application.</li>
  <li>Many bugfixes. See <A HREF="docs/svnlog.txt">docs/svnlog.txt</A></li>
</ul>

<h2>Axis 1.1</h2>

<h3>Changes from 1.0 to 1.1 that may break your code</h3>
<ul>
  <li> We have changed how we map http URLs to packages, such that any directories 
    in the URL are used as well as the hostname. The previous behavior was a defect, 
    as it would import WSDL from the same site into the same place. If you do 
    not explicitly state the mappings of URIs to packages, things may now end 
    up in different places </li>
  <li> The default socket timeout for clients is now 60 seconds, not infinity. 
    You can use the setTimeout() option on any binding (cast it to an <tt>org.apache.axis.client.Stub</tt> 
    first) to change this.</li>
  <li>The API for writing custom schema from a Serializer (writeSchema()) has 
    changed! We now return an Element which should be suitable for either dropping 
    under an &lt;element&gt; or &lt;attribute&gt; declaration as an anonymous 
    type OR for putting a name=&quot;&quot; attribute on and making global in 
    the schema. See any of our included serializers (MapSerializer is a good'un) 
    for an example.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes from 1.1RC2</h3>

  here</a>.</p>
<h3>Changes from 1.0 to 1.1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Vastly improved SOAP 1.2 support
  <li>There is a new email transport in transport/mail
  <li>Added serializers/deserializers for Castor compatibility 
  <li>Improved WSDL schema generation APIs for custom types 
  <li>Added CORBA and RMI providers 
  <li>Improved EJBProvider's ability to be a &quot;good EJB citizen&quot; (deals 
    better with JNDI, etc)
  <li>Improved multiref deserialization code 
  <li>Axis supports JMS for reliable messaging between client and server. Note 
    that the actual wire format of JMS messages is vendor-specific at present, 
    so you may not be able to use this to connect arbitrary JMS clients and servers 
    without special bridging software. Refer to your particular JMS vendor for 
    details. (rule-of-thumb is &quot;if you can get a JMS connection working, 
    we can talk SOAP over it.&quot; :)) 
  <li>We include a more recent version of wsdl4j.jar (23/mar/2003). 
  <li>The misnamed org.apache.axis.encoding.DefaultSOAP12TypeMappingImpl is now 
    called DefaultSOAPEncodingTypeMappingImpl (the old class is still there but 
    deprecated)
  <li>Log4J 1.2.8 is the version of log4J we use, though Axis still works with 
    older versions (i.e. we dont use the XML configuration mechanism.). 
  <li>Many more WSDL and interop issues reported (thank you!) and fixed. 
  <li>One late breaking interop fix was a workaround for a bug in .NET1.0, which 
    does not like empty arrays very much. This fix is not enabled by default. 
    If you have trouble with .NET1.0 clients handling arrays, look up <b>axis.sendMinimizedElements</b> 
    in the global configuaration section of the reference manual. 
  <li>Axis Ant tasks are now documented, and are much enhanced. 
    <!-- you only get this if you build axis yourself, so  
  <li>Axis now includes a Castor serializer, handing off XML marshalling to <a href="http://castor.exolab.org/">Castor</a>. 
    Castor integration offers schema validation and autogenerated Java classes 
    from a Schema. Pending documentation and tests, this code is left for the 
    experienced Castor user, who should look at the classes in org.apache.axis.encoding.ser.castor 
    to discover what is available.
    -->
  <li>Fixed a bug where clients running Java1.4 needed servlet.jar on their classpath 
  <li>Fixed <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13682"> 
    a bug</a> with Axis shutdown on Tomcat 3.3.1 
  <li>Various documentation tweaks: improved installation guide, more reference 
    documentation and a new security guide for anyone using Axis in production. 
  <li>On the subject of security, three security issues were fixed; two related 
    to XML entity/file inclusion on inbound messages and one potentially enabling 
    cross-site-scripting. 
  <li>Tcpmon lets you specify delays in message handling: sleep times in milliseconds 
    every so-many bytes sent or received. This is useful if you want to see what 
    happens to your client application over a slow link. Usually it becomes clear 
    that your client application grinds to a halt unless all the calls are in 
    a separate thread from any GUI. 
  <li>Attachments are extended with direct access to the filename, and the ability 
    to detach the file from the <tt>AttachmentPart</tt> so it wont get deleted 
    on cleanup. Yes, attachments should now get automatically cleaned up when 
    their owning <tt>AttachmentPart</tt> is finalized. Look at the javadocs for 
    the specifics. 
  <li>CommonsHTTPSender updated to use <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/downloads.html">Jakarta 
    Commons's HTTPClient 2.0 RC3</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Improvements in Exception Handling</h4>

    The JAX-RPC specification of exceptions is now implemented; you may well be able
    to send abitrary exceptions over the wire and have them retranslated into Java
    Exceptions at the far end. Of course, non-Java destinations have a little problem there,
    all they get are the XML details to make sense of somehow. There is a lot to
    be said for creating, filling and throwing an <tt>AxisFault</tt> directly, and documenting
    the <tt>faultdetails</tt> elements for callers of all languages to make sense of. Axis now
    makes it easier to work with these details; consult at the <tt>AxisFault</tt> javadocs to
    see the new fault detail methods.
<p>

     Axis no longer reports AxisFaults at INFO level on the client or server,
     unless you configure the logging parameters to do so;
     see the reference documents for details on how to do this. There is one
     exception: we do log server-side any AxisFaults created from RunTimeExceptions
     that are thrown by web service methods you implement. This is because those
     are usually bugs (like null pointer exceptions) that service developers like
     to know about before
<p>

     For security reasons we have stopped sending stack traces over the wire to
     callers by default. The reference manual shows how to enable this on
     development systems.
<p> Finally, we know we still have more to do to get exceptions fully under control. 
  For example, global <tt>OnFault</tt> handlers are apparently not called consistently, 
  and we need to do a lot more interop testing across platforms and languages. 
  We also need a willing volunter to provide a guide to exceptions in SOAP and 
  Axis.
