Test addrNoImpSEI

Summary:
This test is a variant of the AddressBook test.  Unlike
the regular AddressBook test, the server side implementation
(AddressBookNoImplSEISoapBindingImpl) does not
implement the Service Endpoint Interface (SEI).  The 
server side implementation does contain methods that 
correspond to the methods defined in the SEI.
The purpose of this test is to simulate a server side EJB
which will not implement the SEI, but will have methods that
match the SEI.

Step 1:
An AddressBook.wsdl and AddressBookNoImplSEISoapBindingImpl.java
files are provided.

WSDL2Java is run on AddressBook.wsdl to create the client side
artifacts and deployment data.

Step 2:
The generated AddressBookNoImplSEISoapBindingImpl.java is
replaced with the provided one that does not implement the SEI.

Step 3:
These files are compiled to ensure that the generated artifacts
and provided file are correct.  In a normal scenario, we would
run the test at this point.

Step 4:
We now have a setup that simulates the setup for an EJB scenario.
Java2WSDL is run on the server implementation to make sure it 
is possible to generate a wsdl file describing this service.

Step 5:
Prior classes and java files are deleted.
The only way to test the validity of the wsdl file produced in
step 4 is to run WSDL2Java on it.

Step 6:
Replace the generated server side implementation with the provided
one.  Now we are ready to compile all the files and run the test.
